Tips for using hashtags effectively:

Combine popular hashtags (e.g., #fyp, #ForYou) with niche-specific hashtags (e.g., #DIY, #MakeupTutorial).
Avoid overloading your video description with hashtags; 4–6 relevant ones are ideal.
Research trending hashtags daily to stay updated.

Visually appealing content: Use transitions, effects, and high-quality video editing to make your content stand out.

Post consistently in the first few weeks.
Focus on quality and engagement-oriented content to build a strong initial presence.
9. What is a shadowban, and can it affect my likes?

Using banned hashtags or excessive repetition of irrelevant hashtags.
Posting inappropriate or copyrighted content.
Using third-party apps for fake likes or followers.
How to avoid it:

If shadowbanned, give your account a break (1–2 weeks) and clean up any flagged content.
